The OSC - Operating System Concepts - projects consist of three different project, each targeting different concepts of the OS.
---
* The first project concerns Forking. Here I had to use the fork() function to allow for a smooth operating shell. Here I had to use pipes to handle memory sharing between processes.
* The second project concerns Synchronization. Here I had to use mutexes to synchronize readers and writers sharing the same memory.
* The third project concerns Memory. Here I had to use my knowledge of CPU caching to optimize some give piece of code.
